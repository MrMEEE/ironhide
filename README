This will contain a cleaned, Ubuntu only, version of bumblebee.. Now called
Ironhide.. name change mostly to due to the fork away from "The Bumblebee
Project"

Based on the knowledge I've gathered in the last few months..

The code from here should not be used directly, but will be published
through a ppa only...
